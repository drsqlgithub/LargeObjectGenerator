# LargeObjectGenerator
Just a repository of stored procedures that you can use to generate really large objects to test.

StoredProcedureGenerator.sql
Use the procedure in this file as: EXEC dbo.GenerateProcedure <number of items>
The larger the number of items, the larger the procedure it creates (named dbo.BigBoy).
